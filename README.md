### Hello, world!
 
✨ Luisa, Compilers and Formal Languages enthusiast. I also enjoy logics, a lot.

✨ Sometimes singer and art lover - fascinated by creativity in all its shapes

✨ Computer Science and Engineering graduate at Politecnico di Milano, Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge.


### In brief: 

1. [FSM Dialect](https://github.com/luisacicolini/circt/): working within the CIRCT project to exploit the FSM dialect for verification
2. [xDSL](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl/pull/1600): I contributed to the xDSL open-source project
3. [iMFAnt](https://github.com/necst/iMFAnt): automata optimization for faster pattern matching ([CGO'24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfJge7ukAJs&t=106s))
4. [GrCUDA](https://github.com/necst/grcuda/pull/25): I contributed to the GrCUDA open-source project
5. [xohw21-flow-public](https://github.com/luisacicolini/xohw21-flow-public): finalist project for Xilinx Open Hardware 2021 competition, based on the acceleration of the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA) on FPGA
6. [Joule-Brayton-Turbine-Modeling](https://github.com/luisacicolini/Joule-Brayton-Turbine-Modeling): MATLAB thermodynamic model of a small turbojet engine
7. [super-duper-FORtnight](https://github.com/luisacicolini/super-duper-FORtnight): Python- and AMPL-based heuristic approach to VRT problem
8. [Forced-Convection-in-Cooling-Systems-for-Electronic-Components](https://github.com/luisacicolini/Forced-Convection-in-Cooling-Systems-for-Electronic-Components): MATLAB thermodynamic model of a cooling system based on forced convection for small electronic deviced
